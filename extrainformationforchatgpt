our ecommerce will be using react zustand for front end and node js express mongodb for backend. our app will have all required features however we do not want any third party authentication library and dont want to hash any password. login sign up and authorization will still exist yet we just wanna do it with database interraction and dont want to use any session or local storage. we might use session to keep user logged in till he she has not logged out or something easy its just a practice project.
